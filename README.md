# Phase-2-Assessment

# Description

You're almost at the finish line!

Your assessment today will be to build a SINGLE PAGE CRUD event management application.

I have provided the user stories below along with some hints.

# Objectives
Your program will contain users and events
Users can attend many events
Events can be attended by many users
A user can create an event. That event will belong to the user
A user can create multiple events

# User Stories:
As a user, I can register for an account and sign in/out. (i.e. an account has a unique e-mail, password)
As a user, I can create new events (Events have a title, description, location)
As a user, I have a personal page that shows all the events 
a) that I've created and attended
b) based on the chosen location
c) based on the selected date

Personal Page - is a dashboard feature the above three components.

As a user, I can edit events
As a user, I can destroy events
As a user, I want to be able to add an event on the page that lists all my events. When that new event is created, it is appended to the list without the page refreshing.
As a user, I would like a clean and approachable interface.
